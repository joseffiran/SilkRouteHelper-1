# SilkRoute OS Declaration Helper

## Overview

SilkRoute OS is a full-stack web application designed to help companies with shipment declaration processing using AI-powered OCR technology. The system features a React frontend with TypeScript, a FastAPI backend, and PostgreSQL database integration. The application provides user authentication, shipment management, and document processing capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for build tooling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent UI design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation schemas
- **Component Strategy**: Component-based architecture with reusable UI components from Radix UI primitives

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance REST API
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy with Alembic for database migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with PassLib for password hashing
- **API Structure**: Modular router-based organization with separate endpoints for authentication, users, and shipments

### Database Strategy
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL configured through Drizzle ORM on the frontend side
- **Backend Database**: SQLAlchemy models with PostgreSQL integration
- **Migration Strategy**: Alembic for database schema versioning and migrations

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- JWT token-based authentication with secure password hashing
- Session management with token storage in localStorage
- Protected routes with authentication guards
- User registration and login with form validation

### User Management
- User profiles with company information
- Email-based user identification
- Account status tracking and user activity monitoring

### Shipment Processing
- Shipment creation and management
- Status tracking (processing, completed, failed)
- JSON-based extracted data storage for OCR results
- User-specific shipment filtering and organization

### Frontend Components
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Reusable UI components built on Radix UI primitives
- Form components with validation and error handling
- Dashboard with shipment statistics and management

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication Flow**:
   - User submits login credentials through React form
   - Frontend validates data using Zod schemas
   - API request sent to FastAPI backend
   - Backend validates credentials and returns JWT token
   - Token stored in localStorage and used for subsequent requests

2. **Shipment Management Flow**:
   - Authenticated users can create new shipments
   - Shipment data stored in PostgreSQL with user association
   - Real-time status updates through API queries
   - Extracted data from OCR processing stored as JSON

3. **Data Synchronization**:
   - TanStack Query manages server state caching and synchronization
   - Optimistic updates for better user experience
   - Error handling with toast notifications

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies

### Backend Dependencies
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI with Uvicorn ASGI server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with psycopg2 driver
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with Alembic migrations
- **Authentication**: python-jose for JWT handling, PassLib for password hashing
- **Validation**: Pydantic for request/response validation
- **CORS**: FastAPI CORS middleware for cross-origin requests

### Database Integration

- **Frontend ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Backend ORM**: SQLAlchemy with Alembic migrations
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless for scalable PostgreSQL hosting

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit with Node.js 20 and PostgreSQL 16 modules
- **Build Process**: Vite development server with hot reload
- **Backend Server**: FastAPI with Uvicorn in development mode
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL instance with environment variable configuration

### Production Deployment
- **Build Strategy**: Vite production build with static asset optimization
- **Server Bundle**: ESBuild for backend bundling with Node.js target
- **Deployment Target**: Autoscale deployment on Replit infrastructure
- **Port Configuration**: Frontend on port 5000, backend proxy to port 8000

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Hot reload with source maps and development tools
- **Production**: Optimized builds with minification and tree shaking
- **Database**: Environment variable-based connection string configuration
- **Security**: JWT secret management through environment variables
