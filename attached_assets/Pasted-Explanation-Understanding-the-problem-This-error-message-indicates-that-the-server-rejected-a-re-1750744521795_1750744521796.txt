Explanation

Understanding the problem
This error message indicates that the server rejected a request because the client (your browser or application) did not provide valid authentication credentials. In simpler terms, you tried to access a resource that requires you to log in or provide some form of identification, but you didn't do so correctly. [1, 4]

How to verify
To verify this, you can check the network tab in Chrome DevTools. Find the failed request that resulted in the 401 status code. Examine the request headers to see if any authentication headers (like Authorization) are present and if they contain the expected credentials (e.g., a token, username and password, etc.).

Suggested fix
The fix depends on why the authentication failed. Here are a few common scenarios and how to address them:

Missing or incorrect credentials: Ensure your application is sending the necessary authentication credentials with the request. This might involve including an Authorization header with a valid token or other required information.
Expired credentials: If you are using a token, it might have expired. You will need to refresh or re-obtain a valid token.
Incorrect URL: Double-check the URL you are trying to access. Sometimes, an incorrect URL can lead to a 401 error if the server doesn't recognize the requested resource. [3]
Permissions issues: Even with valid credentials, you might not have the necessary permissions to access the specific resource. Check with the server administrator or documentation to confirm your user has the required access rights.
Summary
A 401 Unauthorized error means the server requires authentication but the client failed to provide valid credentials. Verify the credentials being sent, their validity, and the correctness of the requested URL.

workspace_iframe.html:32 Error while parsing the 'sandbox' attribute: 'allow-downloads-without-user-activation' is an invalid sandbox flag.
Explanation

Understanding the problem
This console error indicates that the allow-downloads-without-user-activation flag is not a valid value for the sandbox attribute of an <iframe> element in the current browser. The sandbox attribute is used to apply restrictions to the content within an iframe, and different browsers may support different sets of flags [1, 4].

How to verify
You can verify this by inspecting the <iframe> element in your HTML. Look for the sandbox attribute and check if allow-downloads-without-user-activation is included in the list of values.

Suggested fix
Remove the allow-downloads-without-user-activation flag from the sandbox attribute of the <iframe> element. The flag allow-downloads is the correct flag to permit downloads within the sandboxed iframe, although browser support for allow-downloads within sandboxed iframes can vary [1, 3].

Code

<!-- Before -->
<iframe sandbox="allow-downloads-without-user-activation allow-scripts" src="..."></iframe>

<!-- After -->
<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-downloads" src="..."></iframe>
Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error "Error while parsing the 'sandbox' attribute: 'allow-downloads-without-user-activation' is an invalid sandbox flag" occurs because allow-downloads-without-user-activation is not a supported sandbox flag in the browser. Remove this flag and use allow-downloads instead, if downloads are intended within the sandboxed iframe.
